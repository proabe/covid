# Welcome to Covid-19 APP!

This web app can be used to visualize covid19 data of india (** will be working on world soon**) on map. And can also be used to find **VRDL laboratories** across india capable of testing **covid19**. This application consists of various APIs that can provide covid19 data.

**Please note that  I have worked hard and for days to make this APIs and visualization, you may use it as you see fit but please have this attribution in place: [Created By: Abhishek Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-singh-2939a0aa/). Thank you**
